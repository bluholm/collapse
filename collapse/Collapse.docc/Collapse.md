# ``collapse``

The Collapse app is a survival guide that provides users with a list of ``TopicElement`` containing ``Item`` to resources that are necessary for survival in emergency situations. Users can navigate through the ``TopicElement`` and mark ``Item`` as completed, with the application calculating the overall `score` based on the sum of all completed items and displaying the percentage of completion.

## Overview

The application has three ``Mode``: 
 - ``Mode/essential``,
 - ``Mode/intermediate``,  
 - ``Mode/advanced`` .

Each containing items relevant to the mode. Users can switch between modes to view items and resources specific to that mode.

It's important to note that even if a user chooses to only view items from the Essential mode, their score cannot reach 100% without completing all items in Advanced mode. This is because the application takes into account all items across all modes in its score calculation.
