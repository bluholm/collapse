        "descriptionShort": "Freshwater is essential for human survival, but a water crisis can occur at any time. In the event of a collapse, it is important to know how to find and treat freshwater to ensure your survival. This section will help you understand why freshwater is important in a survival situation and what you need to do to prepare.",
        "descriptionLong": "Freshwater is one of the most important resources for human survival. However, a water crisis can occur at any time and can be caused by a variety of factors such as pollution, prolonged droughts, natural disasters, or armed conflicts. In the event of a collapse, the availability of freshwater can be greatly reduced, making access to and treatment of freshwater even more crucial.\n\nTo survive a freshwater shortage, it is essential to understand how to find, collect, and treat water safely and effectively. To do this, you need to equip yourself with the necessary tools and skills to ensure a constant supply of freshwater.\n\nThe list of things to buy to be prepared includes items such as a portable water filter, plastic water bottles, a metal or plastic water container, water treatment packets, a water quality testing kit, a plastic bucket, and a hose. With these tools, you can filter, store, test, and collect freshwater.\n\nIn addition to tools, it is important to master certain skills to treat freshwater safely. It is important to learn how to find freshwater in nature, how to collect and store rainwater, how to filter and purify freshwater using natural methods, and how to use a portable water filter. You also need to know how to test the quality of freshwater to ensure it is safe to drink.\n\nUltimately, being prepared for a freshwater shortage means understanding the importance of this resource, being equipped with the right tools, and mastering the skills necessary to find, store, treat, and drink freshwater safely. With this knowledge, you will be better prepared to face a water crisis and protect your health and well-being.",

        "descriptionLong": "Electricity is a crucial element of our daily lives, allowing us to heat our homes, cook our meals, light our surroundings, communicate with others, work, and even entertain ourselves. However, in survival situations, electricity can make the difference between life and death.\n\nDuring a crisis or natural disaster, such as a hurricane, snowstorm, or flood, power lines can be damaged or cut, depriving people of access to electricity. In these situations, it is important to have alternative sources of energy to meet your basic needs.\n\nLack of electricity can also cause security problems, as security systems such as alarms, cameras, and electric gates may no longer function. Without electricity, pharmacies, hospitals, and long-term care facilities may be unable to provide adequate care, which can lead to dramatic consequences for patients.\n\nTo be prepared for a prolonged power outage, it is important to equip yourself with a portable power generator, solar panels, energy storage batteries, and other alternative energy sources. Solar lamps and rechargeable lanterns are also essential for lighting, while car battery chargers can be used to recharge your electronic devices.\n\nIn addition to having alternative energy sources, it is important to know the necessary skills to repair simple electrical circuits, install solar panels and charge controllers, and use electrical measuring tools such as a voltmeter and an ammeter. It is also important to learn how to save energy to maximize the autonomy of your electrical systems.\n\nIn conclusion, electricity is a crucial element in survival situations, as it can meet our basic needs and ensure our safety. It is therefore important to prepare for a prolonged power outage by having alternative energy sources and acquiring the necessary skills to repair and maintain these systems.",

        "descriptionLong": "In case of survival, hunting can become a vital skill to obtain food and survive in the wild. When food and water are scarce, hunting can be one of the only ways to obtain the nutrients and energy necessary to maintain health and physical strength.\n\nMeat is an important source of protein, nutrients, and calories necessary for the body. Hunted animals can provide meat, offal, and bones for making broth. Fish can also be an important source of protein and nutrients and can be found in rivers, lakes, and ponds.\n\nBy learning how to hunt and build traps, you can increase your chances of survival and avoid hunger and malnutrition in case of food shortages. Traps can be built to capture animals such as rabbits, squirrels, birds, fish, rats, and mice. Traps can be simple or complex and can include snares, collar traps, pit traps, and net traps.\n\nHowever, hunting can be dangerous and requires proper training to be practiced safely. Firearms and crossbows are commonly used tools for hunting, but they must be used with care. It is important to know firearm safety rules and learn how to handle these weapons safely. Skills such as knowledge of hunting techniques, silent approach, camouflage, tracking, and ammunition making are also important to succeed in hunting safely.\n\nIn addition to the tools and skills necessary for hunting, it is also important to prepare by purchasing appropriate hunting clothing. Hunting clothing should be durable, weather-resistant, and comfortable for extended use. Sturdy boots, gloves, and hunting hats may also be necessary to protect against the elements.",

The snare should be attached to a tree or a stake in the ground to prevent the animal from escaping with the trap.\nInstall the trap: Bury the snare in the ground or place it on a flat surface for the animal to pass through.\nWait: Wait for the animal to be caught by the trap. Snares are designed to tighten when an animal passes through, trapping the animal by the neck.\nRelease the animal: If you catch an animal, it is important to release it quickly and carefully.

It is important to find wood that is flexible and sturdy, but not too thick or heavy.\n\nShape the wood: Once you have found suitable wood, it's time to shape it into a bow shape. This involves cutting it to the desired length and gently bending it into the shape of a bow. You can use tools such as a knife, saw, rasp, and sandpaper to help shape the wood.\n\nAdd notches: Notches are notches made at each end of the bow to hold the bowstrings. You can make them with a knife or saw.\n\nMake the bowstring: The bowstring is made of natural fibers such as hemp or linen bowstring. It must be adjusted to properly hold the bow. To make it, you can use a twisting technique to braid the fibers together.\n\nMake the arrows: To make arrows, you will need wood for the shafts, feathers for the fletching, and tips for the arrowheads. Arrowheads can be made of materials such as stone, flint, or metal. Fletching can be attached with natural glue or resin.\n\nTest your equipment: Once you have made your bow and arrows, it is important to test them to ensure they are effective. You can test the flexibility of the bow by pulling on the string, and test the accuracy of the arrows by shooting them at a target."

Basic chemistry knowledge can also help avoid the dangers associated with handling unknown substances.\n\nBasic products such as vinegar, baking soda, salt, and others are essential to daily life, whether for cooking, cleaning, or health.

All you need to do is let them ferment with a little sugar and water in a warm and dark place for several weeks. The bacteria will transform the alcohol in the mixture into acetic acid, which is the main component of vinegar.\n\nIt's also possible to make vinegar from other ingredients such as wine, beer, or even stale bread.
